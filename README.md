# Advent of Code 2023

Repo for my entries for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

## Usage

To run, use the provided `runner.py` script:

```python
python runner.py [day#] [part# = 1] [dataSet = 0]
# day#: Sets the day to run
# part#: Sets which part to run (defaults to 1 unless 2 is entered)
# dataSet: Which data set to use, 0 (or any negative) is puzzle input, 1+ is for examples 1+
# data sets are stored in the inputs/day-# dir
```
